# Mock Data Generator and Transmitter

A set of tools for generating and transmitting mock sensor data for testing and development purposes. This repository contains Python scripts that simulate sensor data acquisition and transmission to a server.

## Overview

This toolkit consists of two main components:
1. `create_data.py` - Generates mock sensor data at specified rates
2. `read_data.py` - Reads and transmits the generated data to a server

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install pyserial sqlite3
   ```
   
   Note: The `pyserial` package is required for USB serial communication with the Raspberry Pi.
   If you get the error "Import 'serial' could not be resolved from source", run the above command.

## Usage Instructions 

### Generate Mock Data

The `create_data.py` script creates a single SQLite database with all sensor data in one table.

```bash
python create_data.py [latitude] [longitude] [altitude]
```

- Optional parameters:
  - `latitude`: Center point for generating random GPS latitude (default: 44.56457)
  - `longitude`: Center point for generating random GPS longitude (default: -123.26204)
  - `altitude`: Center point for generating random altitude (default: 256)

This script will:
- Create a database file `data_acquisition.db`
- Generate 6000 samples (1 minute of data at 100Hz)
- Include session IDs to group related data

### Read and Transmit Data

The `read_data.py` script reads data from the SQLite database and transmits it to a server according to configuration settings.

```bash
python read_data.py
```

This script uses a configuration file (`config.ini`) to determine how to read and transmit the data.

### Configuration File Format

The `config.ini` file contains settings for the data reader and transmitter. Below is an example configuration:

```ini
[SERVER]
host = example.com
port = 8080
endpoint = /api/data
use_ssl = true
api_key = your_api_key_here

[DATABASE]
path = data_acquisition.db
query_limit = 100

[TRANSMISSION]
frequency = 10
batch_size = 50
timeout = 30
retry_attempts = 3

[LOGGING]
level = INFO
file = transmission.log
```

#### Configuration Sections

1. **SERVER**: Settings for the remote server connection
   - `host`: Server hostname or IP address
   - `port`: Server port number
   - `endpoint`: API endpoint for data submission
   - `use_ssl`: Whether to use HTTPS (true/false)
   - `api_key`: Authentication key for the API

2. **DATABASE**: Database connection settings
   - `path`: Path to the SQLite database file
   - `query_limit`: Maximum number of records to retrieve per query

3. **TRANSMISSION**: Data transmission parameters
   - `frequency`: How often to send data (in seconds)
   - `batch_size`: Number of records to send in each batch
   - `timeout`: Connection timeout in seconds
   - `retry_attempts`: Number of retry attempts if transmission fails

4. **LOGGING**: Logging configuration
   - `level`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
   - `file`: Path to the log file

### Database Structures

#### Single Database (`data_acquisition.db`)
Contains one table `sensor_data` with the following fields:
- `id` - Auto-incrementing primary key
- `sessionID` - Identifier for grouping related data points
- `timestamp` - ISO format timestamp
- `latitude`, `longitude`, `altitude` - GPS coordinates
- `accel_x`, `accel_y`, `accel_z` - Accelerometer readings
- `gyro_x`, `gyro_y`, `gyro_z` - Gyroscope readings
- `dac_1`, `dac_2`, `dac_3`, `dac_4` - DAC channel readings

## Data Format and Ranges

- GPS coordinates:
  - Latitude: -90째 to +90째
  - Longitude: -180째 to +180째
  - Altitude: 0 to 1000 meters
- Accelerometer: -10 to +10 (X, Y, Z axes)
- Gyroscope: -500 to +500 (X, Y, Z axes)
- DAC Channels: 0 to 5 (4 channels)
